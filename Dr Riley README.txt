To build, follow the Building and running section in README.md.

The included tiff.earth file will need to be modified to work with the pc you install it on. The heightfields, features, and cache need the url fields changed to the proper location.

I had tried using lighting, but it looked bad, so I disabled it. If you'd like to try it with lighting, you can comment out the <lighting></lighting> block.

The controls are listed in the README.md file
